# Performance through people: Transforming human capital into competitive advantage

How does developing talent affect financial returns for
firms? This research finds that companies with a dual focus
on developing human capital and managing it well have a
performance edge. These People + Performance Winners
rank among the most profitable firms within their industries.
They further stand out in two important ways: greater
earnings resilience and a superior ability to attract and
retain talent, key advantages as businesses face economic
headwinds and a war for talent. In addition to building skills,
these companies have distinctive organizational capital-that
is, their management practices, systems, and culture. They
challenge and empower employees while fostering bottom-
up innovation to make their human capital investments pay
off. While focusing solely on financial returns is one path to
success, choosing the P+P model of emphasizing people and
performance can yield the longer-term benefits of resilience
and talent retention.

**People + Performance Winners develop talent and deliver
top-tier financial returns in tandem.** We analyze 1,800
large companies across all sectors in 15 countries, sorting
them into four categories based on markers of human
capital development and financial performance over the
prepandemic decade relative to sector peers. P+P Winners
excel on both dimensions. They average high economic
profit and returns on invested capital, similar to firms in our
second category, Performance-Driven Companies. But
P+P Winners put a greater emphasis on talent, with a higher
share of internal role moves and more training for employees.
Members of our third group, People-Focused Companies,
also emphasize talent development but are unable to
translate that into strong financials. Typical Performers stand
out on neither dimension.

**Firms that invest in human capital have greater resilience
and more consistent earnings relative to their peers.**
P+P Winners closely track Performance-Driven Companies
on profitability and shareholder returns. Yet they are
roughly 1.5 times more likely to remain high performers
over time and have about half the earnings volatility. When
the pandemic hit, they maintained profitability and grew
revenues twice as fast as Performance-Driven Companies.
Even beyond the top-quintile financial performers, investing
in talent development seems to pay off: People-Focused
Companies showed more consistency and resilience than
Typical Performers.

**Developing human capital helps firms retain talent and
deliver a better payoff for their people.** P+P Winners are
talent magnets, with attrition rates almost five percentage
points lower than those of Performance-Driven Companies.
Their employees report higher job satisfaction, and they
are 1.3 times more likely to move into higher lifetime
earnings brackets than those of Performance-Driven
Companies. People-Focused Companies have similarly
high levels of employee satisfaction and even lower attrition
than P+P Winners, although not with the same stellar
financial performance.

**P+P Winners achieve higher returns on human and
organizational capital investment.** Firms invest in different
types of capital to boost revenues: physical capital, human
capital, organizational capital, and other varieties of
intangible capital (such as intellectual property and brand).
P+P Winners achieve roughly 30 percent higher revenue
growth than both Performance-Driven and People-Focused
Companies for every dollar they invest in human and
organizational capital (spending that amounts to one-third
of all firms revenue, on average). By contrast, Performance-
Driven Companies generate higher return on R&D and sales
and marketing investment (typically one-eighth of all firms'
revenue) but may stand to gain by making their human and
organizational capital spending more productive.

**Certain mixes of organizational practices are more
effective at activating human capital.** Organizational
capital is the fabric that surrounds employees, and its pattern
matters. We compare the practices of each group using
McKinsey' Organizational Health Index diagnostic and other
firm-level metrics. P+P Winners achieve higher returns with
a signature characterized by consultative and challenging
leadership; bottom-up innovation and collaboration;
positive, inclusive work environments; and rewards and
advancement opportunities for employees. Performance-
Driven Companies have similar leadership styles but are
more externally oriented to customers and competitors, with
less emphasis on company-wide innovation, motivation
work environment, and on-the-job coaching. While People-
Focused Companies have many practices in common with
P+P Winners (such as motivating employees and creating
positive work environments), their leadership is less results-
oriented, and they do not emphasize bottom-up innovation.

**Leaders can transform their organizational capital to
drive sustained outperformance.** People are a company's
core asset, and the organizing principles governing how
they work are crucial to realizing their potential. While some
organizations have a singular focus on financial results,
supporting talent with effective organizational practices
does not come at the expense of performance. Companies
that make their systems more people-centric stand to boost
their bottom lines over the long term~while delivering
for employees as well. At a time of uncertainty and talent
scarcity, leaders can choose to capture lasting benefits by
ensuring that their organizations truly work for their people.
